The user wants to run the campaign with a lookalike audience.
1.  **Analyze the Request:** The task is to use a lookalike audience. This involves selecting or creating a lookalike audience within the Ad Set's "Audience" section.
2.  **Analyze the Screenshot:**
    *   The screenshot shows the Ad Set editing page ("קהל רחב" is selected).
    *   The main panel displays the "Audience" section (Layer 5). This is the correct page and the correct layer.
    *   Within the Audience section, I see "Use saved audience", "Controls" (Location, Age, etc.), "Languages", "Suggest an audience", and "Custom audiences".
    *   Under "Custom audiences", it currently says "None". Below this, there is a blue link "Show suggestions".
    *   Crucially, the search box "Search existing audiences" which is needed to find a lookalike audience (or the "Create new" button to make one) is *not* visible directly under the "Custom audiences" heading.
3.  **Compare Request and Screenshot:** The agent needs to select a lookalike audience. The necessary controls (like the search box or create button) are within the "Custom audiences" part of the Audience layer, but they are not immediately visible. The "Custom audiences" text *is* visible, but it just says "None" and has the "Show suggestions" link below it.
4.  **Classify the Situation:**
    *   Is it the wrong page? No, it's the Ad Set page.
    *   Is it the correct page but wrong layer? No, the "Audience" layer is visible.
    *   Is it the correct page and layer, but the button is not visible? Yes. The "Search existing audiences" box or "Create new" button, which are part of the "Custom audiences" functionality needed for lookalikes, are not directly visible. I see the "Custom audiences" *label* and the "Show suggestions" link below it. The prompt describes a specific sub-case: "If the AI agent's task is to edit a lookalike audience, but you do not see the search box labeled 'search existing audiences', yet you do see a text button labeled 'Custom audiences', you must instruct the agent to click 'Custom audiences' to expand the search box." In this screenshot, I see the label "Custom audiences" (which acts like a section header here) but it's not presented as a clickable button *itself* to expand. Instead, the standard interaction to reveal the search/create options within this section is often by clicking *near* the "Custom audiences" label or sometimes an edit link appears when hovering (which I can't detect). However, the prompt *also* mentions the "Show suggestions" button as a way to reveal *other* controls (like age/gender), which isn't the primary goal here. Let's re-evaluate the "Custom audiences" section structure based on common FB UI patterns and the provided button list. The list includes "Custom audiences (section with dropdown arrow)" and "Search existing audiences (search field)". The screenshot shows "Custom audiences" but no visible dropdown arrow or search field directly below it. It just says "None". This implies the section might be collapsed or needs interaction. Clicking *on* the text "Custom audiences" or the area around "None" is the most likely way to reveal the search/create options.
    *   Is it the correct page, layer, and the button *is* visible? No, the search box isn't visible.

    Therefore, the best classification seems to be **You are on the correct page and the correct layer but do not see the button**. The specific action needed is to interact with the "Custom audiences" section to reveal the search/create options. Clicking on the "Custom audiences" text/label itself is the most probable action.

5.  **Determine Necessary Action:** Based on the classification and the UI, the agent needs to interact with the "Custom audiences" section to reveal the input field for searching or creating audiences. The prompt specifically guides: "If the AI agent's task is to edit a lookalike audience, but you do not see the search box labeled 'search existing audiences', yet you do see a text button labeled 'Custom audiences', you must instruct the agent to click 'Custom audiences' to expand the search box." Although "Custom audiences" here looks more like a label than a button, clicking it (or the area associated with it, like where "None" is displayed) is the standard way to open up this section for editing/selection in Ads Manager.

6.  **Formulate Instructions:** Instruct the agent to click on the "Custom audiences" text or the area showing "None" below it. Since the prompt specifically mentions clicking "Custom audiences", I will use that phrasing.

7.  **Add Important Notes:** Remind the agent that this action should reveal the options to search for or create audiences, including lookalikes.

8.  **Review Rules:**
    *   Only rely on the screenshot: Yes, the "Custom audiences" label and "None" are visible.
    *   No assumptions: Assuming clicking the label expands the section, which is standard behavior and aligns with the prompt's guidance for this specific case.
    *   Correct classification: Yes, "You are on the correct page and the correct layer but do not see the button".
    *   Correct action for the case: Yes, instructing to click "Custom audiences" as per the prompt's specific instruction for this scenario.
    *   Button list usage: Referenced the list to confirm "Custom audiences" and "Search existing audiences" are relevant.
    *   Left tree usage: Not needed.
    *   Top bar usage: Not needed.
    *   Layer structure: Confirmed we are in Layer 5.
    *   Output structure followed: Yes.
    *   No right-panel interaction: Yes.
    *   No right-side audience definition reference: Yes.
    *   Rules adherence: Yes.
