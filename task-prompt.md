   - Locate the campaign name **"קמפיין לשיחת ייעוץ 3.9"** in the **Campaign column** of the dashboard table.  
   - Ensure that the campaign name **exactly matches** the one given in this task.  
   - The name will be **visible in the provided image**, inside a red-marked box with an **index number in the upper left corner** of the surrounding square.

3. **Mark the Campaign name ONLY  in the CHECKBOX:**  
   - Identify the **index number** associated with the campaign.  
   - Verify that this number follows a **sequential pattern** in the same row, meaning the difference between adjacent numbers is **one**.  
   - Use this **index number** to locate the **correct checkbox** in the same row and mark it.

4. **Verify the Selection Before Proceeding:**  
   - Ensure that the checkbox is **properly marked** by confirming that the **"V" (checkmark)** appears next to the correct campaign name.  
   - If the checkmark does not appear, re-evaluate your selection before proceeding.
   - Ensure that you can see in the image that Campaigns tab is SELECTED. You can know that because if Campaigns is selected that the word Campaign is wriiten in blue color and the other tabs ( Ad sets , Ads )  is in black color.

    - The double check means that even though you marked the checkbox, you must not assume that if there's a checkmark then the correct campaign name (as described in the task) was selected. Therefore, you need to verify it's the same name.
    - If it's not the same name, uncheck the checkbox and continue searching for the name, essentially returning to section 2

   - After clicking the Duplicate button, you begin the duplication process. Note that the campaign is not yet duplicated - you are only starting the process.

### **Critical Notes to Ensure Accuracy:**

- **Step-by-Step Execution:**  
  - This task requires **careful execution** where each action depends on the previous step.  
  - **Do NOT perform multiple actions in a sequence** without verifying the result of each step.  
  - Avoid making assumptions—always confirm your actions visually in the interface.
  - **Very important when you need to search for a campaign name:** If you are looking for the campaign name and you cannot find it, you need to scroll through the items in the dashboard advertising table. To scroll the table, you must first place the cursor at a random location within the table and then scroll. In other words, you follow these steps: You place the mouse cursor at a random point using the move_mouse action and then you choose the action related to scrolling to see additional items in order to find what you need. It is very important that when you provide parameters for scrolling, on one hand, you must not scroll too far forward since you might miss items, but on the other hand, you must not give round values to the scrolling function they need to express random human-like behavior because you must appear as a real user THE SCROLL NEED TO BE WITH MOUSE_WHELL ACTION.  WHEN YOU SEE IN YOUR CONTEXT THAT YOU MOVE THE MOUSE TO SPECIFIC LOCATION, YOU DON'T NEED TO MOVE THE MOUSE EACH TIME  This is because when you move the mouse to a specific location on the page, it stays there. It's important to know that this is true as long as you remain on the same page.
  -**Setting Vertical Scroll Parameters** Pay attention that the scrolling should behave like a real person but at the same time your goal is also to scroll at a good pace. In other words, you want to find the balance between scrolling through relatively many items to see as many new names as possible with fewer scrolls while still making it look like human scrolling. Based on this, set the parameters for the mouse_wheel action
  

- **Pay attention to the information you have in the xml tag named AdvancedCampaignEditingPage**
    - When you are on a page where the URL starts with: https://adsmanager.facebook.com/adsmanager/manage/campaigns/edit/ then you should pay careful attention to the information you received in: AdvancedCampaignEditingPage

    - As a continuation of the previous section, when you are on a page where the URL starts with: https://adsmanager.facebook.com/adsmanager/manage/campaigns/edit/ if any popup window appears that covers the interface in the link, then you must prioritize the popup window and choose actions related to the popup window only.
     
- **Image-Based Identification (No Text Extraction):**  
  - **Do not rely on content extraction tools** to identify the campaign name.  
  - Always **verify the campaign name using the provided image**.  
  - The campaign name should be located **inside the dashboard table, in the Campaign column**.

- **Handling Hebrew Text Issues:**  
  - If the campaign name is in **Hebrew**, be aware that interface issues may cause it to appear **reversed**.  
  - If you cannot find the campaign name, **attempt searching by reversing the letters**.

- **Ignore the Delivery Table Column:**  
  - Do **not** reference or interact with the **delivery table column** during this task.
