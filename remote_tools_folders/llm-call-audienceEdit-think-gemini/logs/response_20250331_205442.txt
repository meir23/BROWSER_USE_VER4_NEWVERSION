The user's task is to set up a lookalike audience. This is done within the "Audience" section of the Ad Set settings, specifically by adding a custom audience (a lookalike is a type of custom audience).
1.  **Page Check:** The screenshot shows the Ad Set editing page ("קהל רחב"), which is the correct page.
2.  **Layer Check:** The "Audience" section (Layer 5) is visible, which is the correct layer.
3.  **Button/Control Check:** To set up a lookalike audience, you need to interact with the "Custom audiences" subsection. You would typically use the "Search existing audiences" field to find a pre-existing lookalike or use a "Create new" option. In the screenshot, under the "Custom audiences" label, it says "None", and the search field or create button is not visible.
4.  **Classification:** This situation falls under the case: **You are on the correct page and the correct layer but do not see the button**. The prompt specifically guides: "If the AI agent's task is to edit a lookalike audience, but you do not see the search box labeled 'search existing audiences', yet you do see a text button labeled 'Custom audiences', you must instruct the agent to click 'Custom audiences' to expand the search box." Clicking the "Custom audiences" label/area is the required step to reveal the controls.

<inner thoughts>
1.  **Goal:** Set up a lookalike audience.
2.  **Context:** Same screenshot and task as the previous interaction.
3.  **Analysis:** The location (Ad Set > Audience) is correct. The specific controls (search/create under "Custom audiences") are hidden.
4.  **Classification:** Remains "You are on the correct page and the correct layer but do not see the button".
5.  **Action:** The action remains the same based on the prompt's specific instruction for this case: click "Custom audiences".
6.  **Output:** Reiterate the previous response as the input context hasn't changed. Ensure clarity and adherence to rules.
