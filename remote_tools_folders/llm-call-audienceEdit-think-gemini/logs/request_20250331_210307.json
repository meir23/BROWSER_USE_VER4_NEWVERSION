You may need to scroll down to find the \"Audience\" section.\n</Important Notes>\n\n<inner thoughts>\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The goal is to set up a lookalike audience for a campaign. This requires editing the Ad Set's audience settings.\n2.  **Analyze the Screenshot:**\n    *   Identify the current location in Ads Manager. The main content area shows \"Campaign name\", \"Special Ad Categories\", \"Campaign details\", \"Budget\". These are Campaign-level settings.\n    *   The top breadcrumb navigation confirms this: Campaign > Ad set > Ad. The Campaign level is highlighted.\n    *   The left-hand navigation tree shows the campaign structure: Campaign (\"\u05e7\u05de\u05e4\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05dc\u05e9\u05d9\u05d7\u05ea \u05d9\u05d9\u05e2\u05d5\u05e5 3.9 - Copy\") and an Ad Set (\"\u05e7\u05d4\u05dc \u05e8\u05d7\u05d1\") nested under it.\n3.  **Compare Request and Screenshot:** The task requires Ad Set level access, but the screenshot is at the Campaign level.\n4.  **Classify the Situation:** Based on the discrepancy, the classification is \"You are on the wrong page\".\n5.  **Determine Necessary Action:** To reach the Ad Set level, the agent needs to navigate away from the Campaign level. The most direct way visible in the screenshot is to use the left-hand navigation tree. Clicking on the Ad Set name (\"\u05e7\u05d4\u05dc \u05e8\u05d7\u05d1\") in the tree will load the Ad Set editing view. Clicking the \"1 Ad set\" link in the top breadcrumb could also work, but using the specific Ad Set name in the tree is clearer, especially if there were multiple ad sets.\n6.  **Formulate Instructions:** Provide a clear instruction to click the specific Ad Set name in the left-hand menu.\n7.  **Add Important Notes:** Mention that the current view is the Campaign level and the target is the Ad Set level. Also, preemptively note that scrolling might be needed on the next page to find the Audience section.\n8.  **Review Rules:**\n    *   Only rely on the screenshot: Yes, the navigation elements are visible.\n    *   No assumptions: Yes, not assuming the Ad Set is already configured or what the next screen will show exactly, just how to get there.\n    *   Correct classification: Yes, \"You are on the wrong page\".\n    *   Correct action for the case: Yes, provide navigation steps.\n    *   Button list usage: Not applicable yet, as we are not on the Audience layer.\n    *   Left tree usage: Yes, used for navigation.\n    *   Top bar usage: Considered but decided against for clarity.\n    *   Layer structure: Not applicable yet.\n    *   Output structure followed: Yes.\n    *   No right-panel interaction: Yes.\n    *   No right-side audience definition reference: Yes.\n    *   Rules adherence: Yes.\n</inner thoughts>\n\n<configure recommendation>\nThe current system prompt and rules worked correctly for this scenario. The classification (\"You are on the wrong page\") was accurate, and the instruction to use the left-hand navigation menu to switch to the Ad Set level was appropriate based on the visible elements. No changes to the prompt seem necessary based on this specific interaction. The prompt successfully guided the model to identify the incorrect page and provide the correct navigation action.\n</configure recommendation> "

This involves selecting or creating a lookalike audience within the Ad Set's \"Audience\" section.\n2.  **Analyze the Screenshot:**\n    *   The screenshot shows the Ad Set editing page (\"\u05e7\u05d4\u05dc \u05e8\u05d7\u05d1\" is selected).\n    *   The main panel displays the \"Audience\" section (Layer 5). This is the correct page and the correct layer.\n    *   Within the Audience section, I see \"Use saved audience\", \"Controls\" (Location, Age, etc.), \"Languages\", \"Suggest an audience\", and \"Custom audiences\".\n    *   Under \"Custom audiences\", it currently says \"None\". Below this, there is a blue link \"Show suggestions\".\n    *   Crucially, the search box \"Search existing audiences\" which is needed to find a lookalike audience (or the \"Create new\" button to make one) is *not* visible directly under the \"Custom audiences\" heading.\n3.  **Compare Request and Screenshot:** The agent needs to select a lookalike audience. The necessary controls (like the search box or create button) are within the \"Custom audiences\" part of the Audience layer, but they are not immediately visible. The \"Custom audiences\" text *is* visible, but it just says \"None\" and has the \"Show suggestions\" link below it.\n4.  **Classify the Situation:**\n    *   Is it the wrong page? No, it's the Ad Set page.\n    *   Is it the correct page but wrong layer? No, the \"Audience\" layer is visible.\n    *   Is it the correct page and layer, but the button is not visible? Yes. The \"Search existing audiences\" box or \"Create new\" button, which are part of the \"Custom audiences\" functionality needed for lookalikes, are not directly visible. I see the \"Custom audiences\" *label* and the \"Show suggestions\" link below it. The prompt describes a specific sub-case: \"If the AI agent's task is to edit a lookalike audience, but you do not see the search box labeled 'search existing audiences', yet you do see a text button labeled 'Custom audiences', you must instruct the agent to click 'Custom audiences' to expand the search box.\" In this screenshot, I see the label \"Custom audiences\" (which acts like a section header here) but it's not presented as a clickable button *itself* to expand. Instead, the standard interaction to reveal the search/create options within this section is often by clicking *near* the \"Custom audiences\" label or sometimes an edit link appears when hovering (which I can't detect). However, the prompt *also* mentions the \"Show suggestions\" button as a way to reveal *other* controls (like age/gender), which isn't the primary goal here. Let's re-evaluate the \"Custom audiences\" section structure based on common FB UI patterns and the provided button list. The list includes \"Custom audiences (section with dropdown arrow)\" and \"Search existing audiences (search field)\". The screenshot shows \"Custom audiences\" but no visible dropdown arrow or search field directly below it. It just says \"None\". This implies the section might be collapsed or needs interaction. Clicking *on* the text \"Custom audiences\" or the area around \"None\" is the most likely way to reveal the search/create options.\n    *   Is it the correct page, layer, and the button *is* visible? No, the search box isn't visible.\n\n    Therefore, the best classification seems to be **You are on the correct page and the correct layer but do not see the button**. The specific action needed is to interact with the \"Custom audiences\" section to reveal the search/create options. Clicking on the \"Custom audiences\" text/label itself is the most probable action.\n\n5.  **Determine Necessary Action:** Based on the classification and the UI, the agent needs to interact with the \"Custom audiences\" section to reveal the input field for searching or creating audiences. The prompt specifically guides: \"If the AI agent's task is to edit a lookalike audience, but you do not see the search box labeled 'search existing audiences', yet you do see a text button labeled 'Custom audiences', you must instruct the agent to click 'Custom audiences' to expand the search box.\" Although \"Custom audiences\" here looks more like a label than a button, clicking it (or the area associated with it, like where \"None\" is displayed) is the standard way to open up this section for editing/selection in Ads Manager.\n\n6.  **Formulate Instructions:** Instruct the agent to click on the \"Custom audiences\" text or the area showing \"None\" below it. Since the prompt specifically mentions clicking \"Custom audiences\", I will use that phrasing.\n\n7.  **Add Important Notes:** Remind the agent that this action should reveal the options to search for or create audiences, including lookalikes.\n\n8.  **Review Rules:**\n    *   Only rely on the screenshot: Yes, the \"Custom audiences\" label and \"None\" are visible.\n    *   No assumptions: Assuming clicking the label expands the section, which is standard behavior and aligns with the prompt's guidance for this specific case.\n    *   Correct classification: Yes, \"You are on the correct page and the correct layer but do not see the button\".\n    *   Correct action for the case: Yes, instructing to click \"Custom audiences\" as per the prompt's specific instruction for this scenario.\n    *   Button list usage: Referenced the list to confirm \"Custom audiences\" and \"Search existing audiences\" are relevant.\n    *   Left tree usage: Not needed.\n    *   Top bar usage: Not needed.\n    *   Layer structure: Confirmed we are in Layer 5.\n    *   Output structure followed: Yes.\n    *   No right-panel interaction: Yes.\n    *   No right-side audience definition reference: Yes.\n    *   Rules adherence: Yes.
