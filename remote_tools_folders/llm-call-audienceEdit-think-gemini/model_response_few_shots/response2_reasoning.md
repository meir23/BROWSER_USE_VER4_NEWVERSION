The user's task is to configure a lookalike audience, which is done within the "Audience" section (Layer 5) of the Ad Set settings.
The screenshot shows that the AI agent is currently on the correct page (Ad Set editing page for "קהל רחב"), confirmed by the left navigation and top breadcrumb trail.
However, the visible sections in the central panel are "Ad set name" (Layer 1) and "Conversion" (Layer 2).
The target "Audience" section (Layer 5) is not visible in the current view. According to the defined layer order (1. Ad set name, 2. Conversion, 3. Dynamic creative, 4. Budget & schedule, 5. Audience), scrolling down is required to reach the Audience layer.
Therefore, the situation is classified as: **You are on the correct page but not seeing the correct layer - THIS IS ALSO CALL "SCROLL AND COMBACK TO ME LATTER" MODE**.

<action suggestion>
Scroll down the page until you see the "Audience" section.
</action suggestion>

<Important Notes>
*   You are currently viewing the top sections of the Ad Set settings ("Ad set name" and "Conversion").
*   The "Audience" section, where lookalike audiences are configured, is located further down the page.
</Important Notes>

<inner thoughts>
1.  **Goal:** Configure a lookalike audience.
2.  **Location Check:** The screenshot shows the Ad Set level ("קהל רחב" is selected). This is the correct page.
3.  **Layer Check:** The visible content includes "Ad set name" and "Conversion". These correspond to Layer 1 and Layer 2 in the provided structure.
4.  **Target Layer:** The task requires Layer 5 ("Audience").
5.  **Comparison:** Correct page, but the target layer (Layer 5) is not visible. Current view shows Layers 1 and 2.
6.  **Classification:** This matches the case "You are on the correct page but not seeing the correct layer - THIS IS ALSO CALL 'SCROLL AND COMBACK TO ME LATTER' MODE".
7.  **Action:** The required action for this case is to instruct the agent to scroll down towards the target layer.
8.  **Refinement:** Explicitly state to scroll until the "Audience" section is visible.
9.  **Rules Check:** Adhered to rules regarding screenshot-only information, classification, layer order, and output structure. Did not reference the right panel.

<configure recommendation>
The system prompt and layer structure definition worked as expected. The model correctly identified the current layers based on visible elements ("Ad set name", "Conversion") and determined that scrolling was necessary to reach the target "Audience" layer (Layer 5). No changes are recommended based on this interaction.
