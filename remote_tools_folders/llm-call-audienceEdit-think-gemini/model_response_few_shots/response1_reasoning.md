The user's task is to configure a lookalike audience for the campaign. Audience settings are managed at the Ad Set level.
The current screenshot shows the Campaign editing interface, identifiable by sections like "Campaign name", "Special Ad Categories", and "Campaign details". The top navigation bar also confirms we are viewing the Campaign level ("קמפיין לשיחת ייעוץ 3.9 - Copy" is highlighted, followed by "1 Ad set" and "1 Ad").
Therefore, the current classification is: **You are on the wrong page**.
To proceed with the task, the AI agent needs to navigate to the Ad Set level. The left-hand navigation menu shows the campaign structure. Below the currently selected campaign ("קמפיין לשיחת ייעוץ 3.9 - Copy"), there is an Ad Set named "קהל רחב". Clicking on this Ad Set name will switch the view to the Ad Set editing page where the audience can be configured.

<action suggestion>
1. Click on the Ad Set named "קהל רחב" in the left-hand navigation menu (it's located below the highlighted campaign name "קמפיין לשיחת ייעוץ 3.9 - Copy").
</action suggestion>

<Important Notes>
*   You are currently viewing the Campaign settings. The audience configuration is done within the Ad Set settings.
*   After clicking the Ad Set name, you will be taken to the Ad Set editing page. You may need to scroll down to find the "Audience" section.
</Important Notes>

<inner thoughts>
1.  **Analyze the Request:** The goal is to set up a lookalike audience for a campaign. This requires editing the Ad Set's audience settings.
2.  **Analyze the Screenshot:**
    *   Identify the current location in Ads Manager. The main content area shows "Campaign name", "Special Ad Categories", "Campaign details", "Budget". These are Campaign-level settings.
    *   The top breadcrumb navigation confirms this: Campaign > Ad set > Ad. The Campaign level is highlighted.
    *   The left-hand navigation tree shows the campaign structure: Campaign ("קמפיין לשיחת ייעוץ 3.9 - Copy") and an Ad Set ("קהל רחב") nested under it.
3.  **Compare Request and Screenshot:** The task requires Ad Set level access, but the screenshot is at the Campaign level.
4.  **Classify the Situation:** Based on the discrepancy, the classification is "You are on the wrong page".
5.  **Determine Necessary Action:** To reach the Ad Set level, the agent needs to navigate away from the Campaign level. The most direct way visible in the screenshot is to use the left-hand navigation tree. Clicking on the Ad Set name ("קהל רחב") in the tree will load the Ad Set editing view. Clicking the "1 Ad set" link in the top breadcrumb could also work, but using the specific Ad Set name in the tree is clearer, especially if there were multiple ad sets.
6.  **Formulate Instructions:** Provide a clear instruction to click the specific Ad Set name in the left-hand menu.
7.  **Add Important Notes:** Mention that the current view is the Campaign level and the target is the Ad Set level. Also, preemptively note that scrolling might be needed on the next page to find the Audience section.
8.  **Review Rules:**
    *   Only rely on the screenshot: Yes, the navigation elements are visible.
    *   No assumptions: Yes, not assuming the Ad Set is already configured or what the next screen will show exactly, just how to get there.
    *   Correct classification: Yes, "You are on the wrong page".
    *   Correct action for the case: Yes, provide navigation steps.
    *   Button list usage: Not applicable yet, as we are not on the Audience layer.
    *   Left tree usage: Yes, used for navigation.
    *   Top bar usage: Considered but decided against for clarity.
    *   Layer structure: Not applicable yet.
    *   Output structure followed: Yes.
    *   No right-panel interaction: Yes.
    *   No right-side audience definition reference: Yes.
    *   Rules adherence: Yes.

<configure recommendation>
The current system prompt and rules worked correctly for this scenario. The classification ("You are on the wrong page") was accurate, and the instruction to use the left-hand navigation menu to switch to the Ad Set level was appropriate based on the visible elements. No changes to the prompt seem necessary based on this specific interaction. The prompt successfully guided the model to identify the incorrect page and provide the correct navigation action.
