The user's task is to use a lookalike audience. This action takes place within the "Audience" section (Layer 5) of the Ad Set settings.
1.  **Page Check:** The screenshot confirms we are on the Ad Set editing page ("קהל רחב" is selected). This is the correct page.
2.  **Layer Check:** The "Audience" section heading is clearly visible at the top of the main content area. This is the correct layer (Layer 5).
3.  **Button/Control Check:** The task requires selecting a lookalike audience. This is typically done via the "Custom audiences" subsection, specifically using the "Search existing audiences" field or a "Create new" option. Looking at the screenshot, the "Custom audiences" label is visible, and below it, it says "None". However, the search field ("Search existing audiences") or the "Create new" button are not visible.
4.  **Classification:** According to the rules: We are on the correct page and the correct layer, but the specific control needed (the search box) is not visible. The prompt states: "If the AI agent's task is to edit a lookalike audience, but you do not see the search box labeled 'search existing audiences', yet you do see a text button labeled 'Custom audiences', you must instruct the agent to click 'Custom audiences' to expand the search box." Although "Custom audiences" appears as a label here, clicking on this area is the standard interaction to reveal the search/creation options.
5.  **Conclusion:** The situation is classified as: **You are on the correct page and the correct layer but do not see the button**. The required action is to interact with the "Custom audiences" section to reveal the necessary controls.

<action suggestion>
1. Click on the text "Custom audiences" (where it currently says "None" below it). This should expand the section and reveal the search box or creation options.
</action suggestion>

<Important Notes>
*   You are in the correct "Audience" section.
*   Clicking "Custom audiences" should allow you to search for existing audiences (including lookalikes) or create new ones.
</Important Notes>

<inner thoughts>
1.  **Goal:** Add a lookalike audience.
2.  **Location:** Ad Set > Audience section. Screenshot confirms this location.
3.  **Visibility:** "Audience" section is visible. "Custom audiences" label is visible, but the search box/create button is not.
4.  **Classification:** Matches "Correct page, correct layer, button not visible".
5.  **Action Derivation:** The prompt specifically instructs to click "Custom audiences" in this scenario to reveal the search box. This aligns with typical Facebook UI interaction patterns for this section.
6.  **Instruction Formulation:** Clearly state to click "Custom audiences". Added context about "None" being displayed there.
7.  **Rules Check:** All rules followed, including classification logic, action based on classification, and output structure. No reference to the right panel.

<configure recommendation>
The prompt handled this specific scenario ("button not visible" within the correct section) well by providing explicit guidance for the "Custom audiences" case. The model correctly identified the situation and applied the specific instruction. No changes seem necessary based on this interaction.
