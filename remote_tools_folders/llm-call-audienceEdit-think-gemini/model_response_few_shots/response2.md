The user wants to set up a lookalike audience.
1.  **Analyze the Request:** The task is to configure a lookalike audience. This happens within the Ad Set settings, specifically in the "Audience" layer (Layer 5).
2.  **Analyze the Screenshot:**
    *   Identify the current location: The screenshot shows the Ad Set editing page. This is confirmed by the highlighted Ad Set "קהל רחב" in the left navigation and the top breadcrumb ("קמפיין לשיחת ייעוץ 3.9 - Copy" > "קהל רחב" > "1 Ad").
    *   Identify the visible layers: The central panel shows "Ad set name" (Layer 1) and "Conversion" (Layer 2) sections. The "Conversion location" options and "Facebook Page" selection are clearly visible, belonging to Layer 2.
    *   Identify the target layer: The task requires accessing the "Audience" layer (Layer 5).
3.  **Compare Request and Screenshot:** The user is on the correct page (Ad Set editing) but the required "Audience" layer (Layer 5) is not visible. The visible layers are Layer 1 and Layer 2.
4.  **Classify the Situation:** Based on the analysis, the classification is "You are on the correct page but not seeing the correct layer - THIS IS ALSO CALL 'SCROLL AND COMBACK TO ME LATTER' MODE."
5.  **Determine Necessary Action:** According to the prompt's instructions for this case, the only action is to instruct the agent to scroll down. The target is Layer 5 (Audience). The currently visible layers are Layer 1 (Ad set name) and Layer 2 (Conversion). The layers between the current view and the target are Layer 3 (Dynamic creative) and Layer 4 (Budget & schedule). Therefore, scrolling is necessary to reach Layer 5.
6.  **Formulate Instructions:** Provide a clear instruction to scroll down the page until the "Audience" section is visible.
7.  **Add Important Notes:** Mention the goal is to find the "Audience" section.
8.  **Review Rules:**
    *   Only rely on the screenshot: Yes, the visible layers are identified from the screenshot.
    *   No assumptions: Yes, not assuming the Audience section is immediately below.

    *   No right-panel interaction: Yes.
    *   No right-side audience definition reference: Yes.
