The user wants to run a campaign with a lookalike audience.
The current screenshot shows the Campaign editing page. I can see "Campaign name", "Special Ad Categories", "Campaign details", and "Budget" sections.
The top bar indicates the current level: "קמפיין לשיחת ייעוץ 3.9 - Copy" (Campaign) > "1 Ad set" > "1 Ad". This confirms I am at the Campaign level.
The task requires editing the audience, which is done at the Ad Set level.
Therefore, I am on the wrong page.
I need to instruct the AI agent to navigate to the Ad Set level.
Looking at the screenshot, I can see the campaign structure tree on the left. Below the selected campaign ("קמפיין לשיחת ייעוץ 3.9 - Copy"), there is an item labeled "קהל רחב" which likely represents the Ad Set (indicated by the grid icon).
Alternatively, the top bar shows "1 Ad set". Clicking on this might also navigate to the Ad Set level.
Using the left-hand menu seems more direct and less ambiguous based on the visual structure.

Plan:
1. Identify the current page: Campaign editing page.
2. Determine the target page: Ad Set editing page (specifically the Audience layer within it).
3. Classify the situation: "You are on the wrong page".
4. Provide instructions to navigate to the Ad Set page using the left-hand menu.
