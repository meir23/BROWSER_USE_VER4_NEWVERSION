# Facebook Ads Manager AI Assistant

This project uses Google's Gemini AI model to analyze screenshots of Facebook Ads Manager and provide step-by-step guidance for configuring lookalike audiences, with integration to OpenAI's Computer Use API for automated actions.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture Overview

The system follows a two-stage pipeline architecture:
1. **Gemini AI Analysis**: Processes screenshots to generate textual instructions
2. **OpenAI Computer Use Integration**: Takes these instructions to execute actions

Key components:
- `llm_caller.py`: Handles Gemini API interactions
- `gemini_to_computer_use.py`: Manages the integration between Gemini and OpenAI
- `utils/logging_utils.py`: Centralizes all logging functionality
- `computer_agent_request.py`: Located in parent directory, handles OpenAI Computer Use API calls

## üîÑ Core Workflows

### Main Workflow: Image Analysis to Action
1. User provides a screenshot and optional task description
2. `gemini_to_computer_use.py` orchestrates the process
3. The image is sent to Gemini AI via `llm_caller.py`
4. Gemini analyzes the image using example data and generates detailed instructions
5. These instructions are captured and logged
6. The instructions and image are sent to OpenAI Computer Use API
7. OpenAI suggests concrete actions (e.g., click coordinates)
8. Results from both systems are logged and returned

### Logging Workflow
1. All requests to external APIs are logged before sending
2. All responses are logged upon receipt
3. Integration steps are logged at each point in the process
4. Logs are timestamped and stored in appropriate directories

## üìÅ Code Organization Principles

The code follows these organization principles:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each file has a clear, singular responsibility
- **Utility Extraction**: Common functions are moved to utility modules
- **Consistent Logging**: Extensive logging throughout all operations
- **Standalone Executability**: Main scripts can run independently

Directory structure:
- `/utils`: Contains utility modules (primarily logging)
- `/logs`: Stores API request/response logs
- `/integration_logs`: Stores logs of the integration process
- `/adset_training_images`: Contains example images for Gemini
- `/model_response_few_shots`: Contains example responses for Gemini
- `/test_images`: Contains additional test images

## üîó Critical Dependencies

This project requires:
- Python 3.8+
- `google-generativeai`: For Gemini API interactions (matching their SDK version)
- `openai`: For OpenAI API interactions (version compatibility with Computer Use API)
- `python-dotenv`: For environment variable management

Specific version requirements:
```
google-generativeai>=0.5.0  # Required for file upload support
openai>=1.13.0              # Required for Computer Use API
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Version Constraints**: The OpenAI client must be compatible with the Computer Use API, which may have specific version requirements.

## üìù Logging Philosophy

**Logging is critical to this codebase and should never be reduced.**

Principles:
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Every step of the process must be logged
- **Separation of Log Types**: 
  - `logs/`: API requests and responses to Gemini
  - `integration_logs/`: Integration-specific logs between systems
- **Structured Format**: JSON for structured data, text for responses
- **No Loss of Information**: Complete payloads are always logged
- **Timestamping**: All logs include timestamps in the filename

The `utils/logging_utils.py` module centralizes all logging functionality to keep main code files cleaner while maintaining comprehensive logging capabilities.

## üö® Error Handling Conventions

Error handling follows these conventions:
- Log all errors with detailed information
- Return `None` values for failed operations rather than raising exceptions in top-level functions
- Document error conditions in function docstrings
- Check for required files/paths before operations
- Validate inputs early in the process
- Restore system state (e.g., stdout) in finally blocks

## üîå Integration Points

Key integration points that must be preserved:
1. **Gemini to Computer Use Bridge**: 
   - In `gemini_to_computer_use.py::process_with_gemini_and_computer_use()`
   - Takes Gemini output and passes it to OpenAI

2. **External File References**:
   - `computer_agent_request.py` from parent directory
   - Example images and response files

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## üè∑Ô∏è Naming Conventions

- **Files**: Snake case for utility files, descriptive names for main files
- **Functions**: 
  - `generate()`: Main Gemini interaction
  - `process_with_gemini_and_computer_use()`: Main integration function
  - `log_*()`: Logging utility functions
- **Variables**:
  - API responses with descriptive names (e.g., `gemini_response`, `computer_use_response`)
  - Constants in UPPER_CASE (e.g., `INTEGRATION_LOG_DIR`)
- **Logs**: Named with function and timestamp (e.g., `gemini_response_20250331_123456.log`)

## üß™ Test Coverage Requirements

Tests are provided via standalone scripts:
- `test_gemini_to_computer.py`: Tests the full integration
- `test_integration.py`: Tests the integration with OpenAI
- `test_with_new_image.py`: Tests Gemini functionality on new images

When modifying code:
- Run all test scripts to verify functionality
- Check log outputs for expected content
- Ensure test images are properly processed

No formal unit tests are implemented, but test scripts should be maintained to demonstrate functionality.

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

- **Streaming Responses**: Gemini responses are streamed for faster feedback
- **Image Encoding**: OpenAI requires base64 encoding, which can be memory-intensive for large images
- **Stdout Capture**: The current implementation captures stdout, which may not be efficient but preserves complete outputs

## üö´ Do Not Modify List

These elements should not be modified:
- **Logging Mechanism**: Do not reduce or remove logging functionality
- **Core API Interfaces**: Maintain compatibility with Gemini and OpenAI APIs
- **Example Content**: Do not alter training images or example responses
- **System Prompt**: The system prompt is carefully crafted for specific behaviors

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management

Configuration is handled through:
1. **Environment Variables**: API keys stored in environment
2. **Dotenv**: `.env` file support for local development
3. **Hardcoded Paths**: Some paths are hardcoded and need to be preserved

Models and parameters:
- Gemini model: Currently `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25`
- Temperature setting: 0.4 (lower for more consistent outputs)

## üìö API Documentation

### Gemini API
- Uses file upload capability for image processing
- Requires few-shot examples to guide behavior
- Includes a system prompt for consistent behavior

### OpenAI Computer Use API
- Called via `send_initial_computer_request()` in parent directory
- Requires image and textual instructions
- Returns suggested actions and reasoning

## üßµ Thread Safety

The code is not specifically designed for multi-threading. Key considerations:
- Global `stdout` manipulation in `gemini_to_computer_use.py`
- Shared log directories that could have conflicts with parallel execution
- No thread locks on shared resources

## üóÑÔ∏è State Management

This system is primarily stateless with no persistent state between runs.
Temporary state includes:
- Captured stdout during Gemini API calls
- In-memory API responses before logging

## üîí Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Stored in environment variables, never in code
- **Image Data**: User-provided images are processed but not permanently stored
- **Logging**: Complete API responses are logged, which may include sensitive data

## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to this project:
1. Maintain all logging functionality
2. Keep the separation between Gemini and OpenAI integration
3. Preserve the capability to run each component independently
